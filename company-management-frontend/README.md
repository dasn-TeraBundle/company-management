# Company Management - Client Side App

## Prerequisites

* **NodeJS v8+**
* **NPM**
* **Angular CLI**

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. This will connect to your Backend App running on port 8888. Change `proxy.conf.json` depending on the PORT and Context Path
your backend app is running. This way you can work on both backend and frontend app at same time.


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
